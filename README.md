The "WeatherApp" project on Angular is a web application for viewing the weather and forecast for 3 days in different cities. The app uses the OpenWeather API to get up-to-date weather information. The main functionality of the application includes:

City search and selection: The user can enter the name of the city in the search field, after which the application will offer options for suitable cities for selection.

Current Weather View: After selecting a city, the user can view the current weather, including temperature, humidity, wind speed and other parameters.

3 Day Forecast: The app displays the weather forecast for the next 3 days, allowing the user to plan activities and prepare for weather changes.
